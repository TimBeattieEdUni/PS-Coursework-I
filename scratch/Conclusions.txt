Conclusions:

The build system enabled programmers to work on classes, tests, and the application effectively with an edit-build-test cycle of only a few seconds.  

Class Landscape was conceptually very simple - maintain a landscape and update it - but it grew into the largest and most complicated class by far.  It could be improved by creating separate classes for each task - a LandMaskApplier class to apply a land/water bitmask to the Landscape's Cell array, for example, or a PopulationApplier class to apply a population of pumas or hares. 

Unit testing, if the group had done it rigorously from the start on all classes, would probably have saved the group two days lost to bugs in array-image conversion and neighbour calculation in the final week before the deadline.

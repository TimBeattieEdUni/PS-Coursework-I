Still to do, in order of priority
	Performance text should "justify choice of metrics when investigating performance."
	Fix scaling factor - apply densities between 0 and 5 and make scaling 10
	Contribution questionnaire.
	Text about compiler warning flags.
	Performance text: timing runs were piped to file, which may have improved speed.
	Add link to GitHub project to report.
	Text about Doxygen why everything is commented even if obvious.  Where to put this?
	Mention astyle for code clean-up.
	Investigation with north pumas and south hares - shows border between them blurring.
	Investigation on island - what density of hares allows pumas to survive?
	Investigation with packs of pumas.
	Test performance as land/water ratio changes.
	Test performance as land varies from one continent to many small islands - branch prediction should be killed by this.
	Further investigations island with ithsmus between large areas of pumas on one side and hares on the other
	Further investigation: diffusion rates set to 0.
	Write up landscape generation tool.
	Text about Landscape swapping its arrays - made its interface easy to use "wrong".
	There's an umlaut over the U in UnitTest++ - why?
	Should "Figures" directory be in report or in scratch?
	Pad output file names with zeroes so they list in order.
	Clean up Doxygen warnings.

\section{Further Work}
\label{Further Work}

\subsection{Further Work on the Implementation}
Given further time the group would have liked to include a unit test for the timing methods for completeness.
While a function called \texttt{ApplyPopulation} was added to the \texttt{Landscape} class which would allow the passing of a tailored array of pumas and hares to the class, there was insufficient time to implement this as an option within the program. 

\subsection{Further Performance Testing}

As described in Section \ref{Debugging} there was an array-indexing bug which was not apparent until the program was run on a non-square landscape. 
Given more time the group would have liked to investigate the performance of the code for non-square input maps.
Specifically the group could have investigated program duraton while varying one dimension and keeping the other constant. 
Another interesting test would have been to produce two alternative land/water mask files that were simply rotated ninety degrees and investigate any performance degredation dependant on which dimension is largest.

% How you planned your work

\label{Planning}
At the first meeting it was decided to set up version control, for details see sec.\ref{Revision Control}, and to create a Tasklist.
The latter was structured along the lines described in the "starting your project" section of the courserwork description and everyone
added specific tasks he could think of to the variouse sections and mark them as essential, i.e. needed for a basic implementation of the project, or polish.
After this Tasklist was established we agreed on a coding standard, build system and test framework, see sec.(\ref{Build Tools}) and sec.(\ref{Testing}), which was setup subsequentely.
It was than decided on the overall programm design/layout, see sec.(\ref{Design}), which led to the aim of writing the needed code/classes and their Unit Tests.
With the essential part of the Tasklist therefore implemented the focus was planned to be shifted to the "polish" tasks starting with profiling and optimisation (see sec.(\ref{Performance Tests and Analysis}).

However, in the real execution this was followed only up to the actual coding of the unit tests as profiling and optimisation was performed before carefull unit tests were in place.

% Brief Summary of what tasks each member of the group did
\section{Assignment of tasks to group members}
\label{Assignment of tasks to group members}

At the start of the project there was no strict assignemt of tasks but rather, as mentioned in sec.(\ref{Planning}), a task list. It was agreed upon that one plainly picks a task to work on, starting with the ones needed for the basic implementation, and writes an email to the group members about what he is working on to prevent two people working on the same item.
As the deadline approached tasks where assigned mainly on the basis of each persons skills and knowlegde of the allready existing parts of the programm in order to get the best performance. This led to the fact that as time went on and the programm code got more involved it was increasingly difficult for groupmembers who had not previously worked on the code to contribute much to the programms development.
The following is a crude listing of tasks with respect to the group members.
